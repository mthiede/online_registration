== Online Registration Concrete/Rails Demo

This demo is a Ruby on Rails application implementing a online registration platform. 
The platform allows its users to setup online registrations via a Concrete based DSL. 

An online registration is basically defined by the data items which need to be collected 
from participants and the pages which hold the input fields for the data items. 
Pages can be conditional and they may contain constraints on the data being collected. 

You can check out this demo live at http://concrete-editor.org
